       <p>I am an incoming Assistant Professor of Microelectronics Thrust at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) in March 2024. Currently, I am working as a Staff Analog Designer at Synopsys Canada to design the analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits for high-speed and high-performance interfaces. Before joining in Synopsys, he was a Mitacs Elevate Postdoctoral Fellow and a sessional instructor in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, McMaster University. I received Ph.D. degree in biomedical engineering from McMaster University, Canada in 2021. His current research interests include high-speed optical sensors and high-performance integrated circuits for emerging applications.</p>
